### Hi there 👋

My nane is Karan. I am currently pursuing my Masters at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am working as Research Assitant at the [Ariasystems.group](https://www.ariasystems.group/karan.html)

My reasearch interest lies at the intersection of Autonomous Systems, Controls, and Formal Methods. My goal is to eventually make robots technologies especially Autonomous systems- feasablie i.e safer and smarter to use in our day-to-day life. 

Please reach out to if you have any question in general at - karan.muvvala@colorado.edu
