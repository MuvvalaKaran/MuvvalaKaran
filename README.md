Hey, I am Karan, a Second-year Ph.D. student in the Aerospace Engineering Dept. at CU. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at [Aria Systems](https://www.ariasystems.group) advised by Dr. [Morteza Lahijanian](http://www.mortezalahijanian.com/). At ARIA Systems group I work on developing theories and algorithms that enable robots to operate safely, robustly, and efficiently in unknown and dynamic environments. Currently, I am working on

- **Verifying** the safety of complex autonomous systems modeled as neural networks and certifying their behaviors using Barrier Methods for Safe Autonomy. 
- And **Synthesizing** high-level strategies for a robotic manipulator operating in the presence of a human using game-theoretic approaches to enable more human-like behavior for robots.

My current research interest includes Formal Methods, Verification and Planning for Autonomous systems, Game Theory, and Control Theory.

Please reach out to if you have any questions in general at - [karan.muvvala@colorado.edu](mailto:karan.muvvala@colorado.edu). Thank you!
