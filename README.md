My nane is Karan - a budding Roboticist from India. I am currently pursuing my Masters at the University of Colorado Boulder, USA - [Robotics and Systems Design](https://www.colorado.edu/mechanical/research/research-focus-areas/robotics-and-systems-design-research) Track. I am working as a Research Assitant at the [Aria Systems](https://www.ariasystems.group/karan.html) with Prof. [Morteza Lahijanian](http://www.mortezalahijanian.com/) on "Scalable Reactive Synthesis for Manipulators in interactive envs with safety guarantees" at the [Aerospace Engineering Scineces](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/) Department.

My reasearch interest lies at the intersection of Autonomous Systems, Controls, and Formal Methods. My goal is to eventually make robotics technologies especially Autonomous systems feasablie i.e safer and smarter to use in our day-to-day life. 

Please reach out to if you have any question in general at - [karan.muvvala@colorado.edu](mailto:karan.muvvala@colorado.edu). Thank you!
